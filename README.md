# Deep Convolutional MNIST Classifier using Tensorflow

This is a convolutional nerual network with 11 conv-layer and 3 fc-layer base on VGG19, I removed 8 conv-layer and 3 pooling layer to make sure all datas fits in my GPU memory. The project is based on github project tensorflow-vgg19 [https://github.com/machrisaa/tensorflow-vgg]
